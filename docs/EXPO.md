# HOW TO RUN WITH EXPO GO

Expo Go doesn't contain this library out of the box. But likely Expo SDK 42 brought us Custom Development Clients and you can run any custom native library in the expo project without ejection. With EAS cloud builds you can do it even on Windows-based machines!

Since all steps to run react-native-esc-pos-printer with expo don't require any additional configurations for lib itself, please follow the official Expo documentation.

### Here is a short video explaining how it works:
